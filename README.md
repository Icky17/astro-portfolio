Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

Any blogs or casestudies can be placed in the `src/posts` directory.

Your personal data would be go on `src/data` directory.

## ðŸ§ž Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:
